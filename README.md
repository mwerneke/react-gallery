# React-Gallery



## Description

This project was intented to Create a Gallery of images, that are stored in a Database and rendered on the DOM. When you click on a picture the item was conditionaly rendered to show additional comments regarding the picture. A user was able to click a like button for the individual photo, that was able to keep track of the likes, similar to the Facebook picture/user interface.

The project demonstrated the ability to create a DB in Postico, while setting up `axios` call to `GET` data from our `/gallery` and render it in the application
 
- I created a few **components** and utilized `props` to pass the items created.

- Conditonal rendering was also utilized in a fashion, that the user was able to select an image that was rendered in order to view comments pertaining to the individual image.

This was a great project to hone in on using `axios` calls to the DB to render data stored.
